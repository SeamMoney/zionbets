 and for a traditional user to deploy stake to a pool of validator(s). on deposit of stake users get a Token
  will be.

during this phase we will also be indexing validator performance to select validators for our curated multi-validator stake pools

- support 4 wallets 
- protocol managed staking mechanism
- multi-strat/LP pools

## After mainnet launch
once core staking and yield mechanisms are built out we are going to shift our focus towards building out our Dao and iterating on our implementation of Composables and 

more info about the Dao can be found here [link]("/dao")

## Our Goals
  - provide users with an in

  - capture at least 8% of the staking marketshare on aptos
